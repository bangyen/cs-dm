If P and Q are of type Prop, we think
of P → Q as a proposition in the form
of an implication. 

Moreover, as we've seen, the way that 
we give a proof of P → Q in the logic
of Lean is to produce a function that,
if given a proof of P returns a proof 
of Q.

On the other hand, nothing in Lean will 
prevent our using types such as nat and
bool as P and Q. In this case we'd say
that P → Q, or nat → bool, is a type: a
type of functions from P → Q, e.g., from
nat to bool.

EXERCISE: Give two or three examples
of interesting functions from nat to
bool. A program that takes any natural
number as an argument and always returns
a Boolean value as a result is a value
(a "function", or it would be better to
say, a lambda expression) of this type, 
ℕ → bool.

Here's a function that returns boolean true
(tt) if a given natural number n is greater
than or equal to zero and less than 2^32. It
is given using lambda notation. Write it with
a prime on its name using ordinary function
definition notation (as the functions above
are written).

    λ n, 
        if n >= 0 ∧ n < 2^32 then tt else ff

/-
Read the first line as saying positive'
is a proof of (a value of type) nat → bool.
There are many values of this type: they
are all the functions taking nat arguments
and returning bool results. The specific
value that we use here to "prove the type"
is the function that returns true if the
argument is strictly greater than zero,
otherwise is returns false.

Read the lambda expression as follows:
A function that takes an argument, n, of
type nat, and that returns the result of
evaluating the expression, involving n,
after the comma: here, true if n > 0,
and false otherwise.

Here's an equivalent expression using 
type inference to skip declaring the
type of n.
-/

def positive'' : nat → bool :=
    λ n, if n > 0 then tt else ff 

/-
Here we use type inference to skip
declaring the function type, while
still using a lambda expression for
the program.
